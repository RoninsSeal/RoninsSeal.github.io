        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <p>
        There was a global pandemic that had taken the world by surprise at the start of 2020. A virus had started in Wuhan,
        China had reached almost every faucet of the world, travel, work, social life, education, etc. Education in particular 
        has hit the younger generation as thousands of students are now learning in from a computer screen in their own homes. 
        On this webpage, I, a grade 11 student, will be going over my thoughts on virtual learning and its effects on students.

        <h2>Learning</h2>
        <p>
        RGSS is a 1:1 school, meaning that most, if not all students in the school should have a technological 
        device that can be used to do whatever a courses deems necessary. Because of this, the transition to virtual 
        was not as harsh for us, because many of the resources in class were also online. Plaftforms such as 
        <a href="https://meet.google.com/">Google Meet</a> and <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a> were used to teach classes

    <!--How online learning affects student's social life-->
    <div>
        <h2>Social</h2>
        <p>
            While it is not their main purpose, high schools do a really good job of facilitating social connections. Students
            that saw each other in multiple classes  in school used to interact with each other often. This can take place only as well
            due to the fact that all students have some piece of technology allow them to connect 
            with each other even once they leave the building. Some of these platforms include
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.snapchat.com/">Snapchat</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/">Instagram</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://twitter.com/home?lang=en">Twitter</a></li>

            <li><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/en">Tik Tok</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The number of concurrent users on these platforms have 
            <a href="https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2020-july-global-statshot">increased drastically as a result of this lockdown</a>, 
            and also due to the fact that it can get lonely always being in your own home.

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
            Virtual learning has been strongly considered even before COVID-19, and after partaking in it for over a year, here are my thoughts. 
            Growing up in the age technology, I was initially excited to see what it would like to learn completely online. 
            While I can't say that it was a terrible experience, there are definitely some improvements that can be made to the formatting of virtual learning.
            Fortunately, I can confidently say that it has improved over the course of the year and there are parts of virtual learning I actual think are
            well implimented. Here are some of my thoughts in no particular order
        </p>
        <br/>

        <h3 id="conclusion-header">The lunch period should be reduced</h3>
            <ul>
                80 minutes of break time is a lot of time to eat and possibly go for a walk. Even if you go walk to your local food chain, it shouldn't take
                more than 40 minutes to get to and from the restaurant. This time could be cut down so that there could be more time at the end of the day
                for students to do schoolwork or other hobbies. I also heard from some of my friends in virtual school the lunch period is only 40 minutes long.
                They should take our 20 minutes long.
            </ul>

        <h3 id="conclusion-header">Feedback days are a nice break</h3>
            <ul>
                I personally enjoy taking half days as they give you time to work and time to relax, unlike the weekend. I occassionly went to the extra helps that the teachers set up,
                and it helps with students who are falling behind or if you are just hung up on one particular concept. This doesn't work for some normal classes because they cannot afford
                to slow down.
            </ul>

        <h3 id="conclusion-header">It's very difficult to network amongst students</h3>
            <ul>
                The human element of socializing is seeing someone face to face and seeing their emotions change, and thay can be hard to see when everyone has their cameras off. I'm not saying
                that everyone should be turning on their cameras, I usually like mine off as often as possible. But if you didn't have a friend group before this pandemic, it would be really hard
                to make friends in this environment. My brother came to RGSS this year, and he said he has had trouble meeting new people. This cannot be helped as this is just how students in 
                virtual learning are, but I hoping for the day we can return back to school and see each other. I know that some teachers would enjoy that a lot as well c:
